title: Amazon Web Services Unveils Its first Quantum Chip called “OCELOT”
description: >-
  Just 10 days after Microsoft announced its quantum chip, another tech giant,
  Amazon, introduced its own quantum chip called Ocelot on February 27, 2025.
  With two major announcements in such a short time, it feels like we are
  entering a new phase of the quantum computing race. Are we witnessing the
  beginning of a competition that will shape the future of technology?

# ![](/images/Acelot.jpg)Amazon Claims about OCELOT

Right now, one of the biggest challenges in quantum computing is **errors** they happen a lot, and fixing them requires **a huge amount of resources**. Ocelot claims to helps solve this problem by **reducing the cost of error correction by up to 90%**, making quantum computing more practical.

This chip was developed by experts at **Caltech (California Institute of Technology)** and represents a big step toward building **powerful quantum computers**.

### *AWS designed **Ocelot** in a unique way by **building error correction directly into its foundation**. Instead of fixing errors after they happen, the chip is designed to **prevent certain types of errors from occurring in the first place**.*

To achieve this, AWS used a special type of qubit called a **“cat qubit,”** named after Schrödinger’s cat, a famous thought experiment in quantum physics. **Cat qubits naturally resist some errors**, which means quantum computers using them need far fewer resources for error correction.

For the first time, AWS researchers have successfully combined **cat qubits** with additional error correction techniques **onto a single microchip**. The best part? This chip can be **mass-produced** using methods borrowed from the microelectronics industry just like how regular computer chips are made. This brings us **one step closer to building large-scale quantum computers**.

# **Amazon’s Ocelot(Cat Qubits) VS Microsoft’s Majorana(Qubits)**

Although
 it’s still too early to compare these two quantum computers, benchmarks
 for both chips will soon be available to the public. Each chip takes a 
different approach to quantum computing and is designed with distinct 
goals in mind. Here’s a quick overview of their differences.

# In Simple Terms,

*   **Ocelot (AWS)**: Uses **cat qubits** to **reduce errors naturally** and can be **mass-produced more easily**.

*   **Majorana Qubits (Microsoft)**: Uses **special quantum particles** to make **theoretically perfect qubits**, but it’s still in the experimental stage.

AWS’s **Ocelot is a more practical step forward**, while Microsoft’s **Majorana qubits, if proven, could be a game-changer but are still far from being usable at scale**.
